<h2>Usage Notes:</h3>  

<item>Short URL:</item>

<p>Enter the alias of your desired short url here.  This is the ending portion of the url.</p>  

<p>For example entering "test" in the short url field will create a short url of http://domain.com/go/test/ </p>

<p>You can use letters and numbers here, as well as dot " . "
Using a dot allows you to create a url which appears as a page.  As in test.html, buy.php, etc.</p>  

<p>Leave it blank to auto generated.</p>

<item># of Links to Open</item>
<p>Multiple links open with a single click only if the short url is published on this blog in a post, page, or custom post.</p>  

<p>If short url is directly accessed via type in, or via a link on an external domain only one link will be opened at random.</p>

<p>This feature works best in firebox & chrome. </p>

<p>Internet Explorer will give a pop up warning asking the clicker to confirm they do want to open multiple links.</p>

<item>Long Url:</item>

<p>Enter the long url which you would like shortened.
If you wish to enter multiple long urls for the same short url, click the "add long url" link at the bottom to open a new field.</p>

<item>Probability:</item> 
<p>Enter Numerical value only.</p>


<item>Attributes (NEW since 3.00):</item> 
<p>You may use it to enter additional link attributes, for example: rel="nofollow" style="color:red" etc.</p>
